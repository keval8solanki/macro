# Roadmap

This document outlines the future plans and improvements for **Macro**.

## User Experience (UX)

- [ ] **GUI Application:** Develop a full graphical user interface (GUI) to replace or complement the CLI. This will make the tool more accessible to non-technical users.
- [ ] **System Tray Icon:** Add a system tray icon for quick access to start/stop recording/playback and status indication.
- [ ] **Visual Feedback:** Implement an overlay or on-screen display (OSD) to show current status (Recording/Playing) and countdowns.
- [ ] **Macro Editor:** Create a visual editor to modify recorded events (e.g., adjust timing, remove accidental clicks, edit keystrokes).

## Core Functionality

- [ ] **Conditional Logic:** Add support for basic logic in macros (e.g., "If image found on screen, click here").
- [ ] **Looping & Branching:** Implement more advanced looping controls and branching based on conditions.
- [ ] **Scheduled Execution:** Allow macros to be scheduled to run at specific times or intervals.
- [ ] **Hotstrings:** Support for text expansion (typing a short abbreviation expands to a longer text snippet).

## Performance & Technical

- [ ] **Event Optimization:** Implement algorithms to smooth out mouse movements and remove redundant events to reduce file size and improve replay smoothness.
- [ ] **Native Hooks:** Explore lower-level native hooks for even lower latency and better compatibility with anti-cheat software (where ethical/allowed).
- [ ] **Plugin System:** Design a plugin architecture to allow community-created extensions and actions.
- [ ] **Cloud Sync:** Optional feature to sync macros and configurations across devices.

## Documentation & Community

- [ ] **Tutorial Videos:** Create short video tutorials demonstrating common use cases.
- [ ] **Recipe Repository:** specific repository or section for sharing useful macro "recipes" or templates.
